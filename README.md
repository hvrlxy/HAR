# Human Activity Recgonition using Accelerometer Datasets

This repository is used to test out different machine learning approach to perform human activity recognition tasks. The dataset employed is the UCI Machine Learning repository, released under the paper ***Human Activity Recognition from Accelerometer Data Using a Wearable Device*** (Pierluigi Casale, Oriol Pujol & Petia Radeva).
